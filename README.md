# Project Title

Prokaryotic diversity and potentially pathogenic bacteria in vended foods and environmental samples

# Introduction

Ready-to-eat fast food vending outlets provide a cheap and readily available food. Foodborne diseases have been previously reported in Embu, Kenya, but data on the prokaryotic metagenome in vended foods is scanty. This study aimed to determine the prokaryotic diversity in fruits, vegetable salad, African sausage, chips (potato fries), fried fish, roasted beef (meat), smokies, samosa, soil, and water collected from food vendors and the surrounding environment in Embu Town and Kangaru Market.

# Methodology 

1. Sample collection - fruits, vegetable salad, African sausage, chips (potato fries), fried fish, roasted beef (meat), smokies, samosa, soil, and water
2. DNA extraction - Phenol-chloroform method
3. Amplification and library preparation - 16S rRNA gene variable region (V4-V7)
4. Sequencing (Illumina)
5. Sequence Analysis - QIIME2 
6. Statistical analysis - R (Hierarchical clustering of samples, diversity indices, rarefaction curves, and Venn diagrams)

# Results and discussions
- All samples had significant diversity of of microorganisms
- The microbes varied as depending on the sites and samples
- The highly represented was bacterial phyla (Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacterioides)
- Proteobacteria in has been detected in drinking water, Fimicutes in solid food









Bacteria formed the most (over 99%) abundant taxa in all the vended foods and environmental samples. This study determined that the most abundant bacteria phyla were Proteobacteria (52.81%), Firmicutes (31.16%), and Bacteroidetes (8.00%). Previous studies have reported the abundance of these phyla in soil and food (Gangwar et al. 2009). Proteobacteria pathogens have been detected in drinking water and were associated with biofilm formation in water pipes and leakages (Richards et al. 2018). Firmicutes have been reported to adapt to solid food which increases their activity; thus, they can thrive in many solid foods (Hugenholtz et al. 2017). This was evident in the present study, where they thrived in potato fries. Sequences affiliated to archaeal phyla; Euryarchaeota (3.36%) and Thaumarchaeota (96.64%) were detected in this study. The archaea orders Methanoarcinales, Nitrosopumilales, Nitrososphaerales, Methanomicrobiales, and Methanobacteriales were recovered from vended food and soil samples. The order Nitrososphaerales is known to inhabit terrestrial ecosystems, and these prokaryotes must have been introduced in the soil following surface water runoff and found their way into food following its mishandling (Kerou and Schleper, 2015a, b; Cavicchioli et al. 2003). Methanomicrobiales have been shown to inhabit a broad range of anoxic environments (Browne et al. 2017). Methanobacteriales prefer anaerobic environments such as marine and freshwater, animal gastrointestinal tracts, and geothermal habitats. The presence of this order in the soil explains the possibility of the introduction of the prokaryote by surface water runoff from animal waste from the surrounding area (Liu 2010).
